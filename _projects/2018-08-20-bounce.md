During July 2018, I had been working for Bounce, a startup company, to create the interface design for the web version of their iOS app Bounce. I worked individually through the project and handed the design over through Zeplin. 

I created landing page, dashboard, hosting screen, profile page, and other minor windows with all graphics made by my own. i also designed three email templates for email confirmation, transaction received, and event paid.

Bounce is an app that provides easy money collecting experience for event hosts and attendees, and also supports person to person transferring.

Here is my approach to complete the design.

## Goals

![](/images/bounce/goals.png)

The project has three main goals that need to be achieved.

* Full-featured: the web version of Bounce are designed to contain all functions that are currently available on iOS app, and needs to include a number of planned features in addition to prepare for the future.
* Modern design: as directed by Bounce's founders, the website should be using blue and gradient theme, and equipped with clean, simplistic, flat styles.
* Low cost to implement: it should not take too much work of complex front-end coding to implement the design, since Bounce is a startup company with limited resource and budget.

## Roadmap

After communicating with Bounce's co-founders, I was able to plan out the project milestones and tasks in details. The plan was followed well, and I actively posted work in progress designs for feedbacks.

## Userflow and Prototypes

I sketched userflows and wireframes from scratch, and added interactions on the wireframes to test usability.

## Bounce Design System

As Bounce being further developed in late 2018 and early 2019, I found that it needs a clearly design system for maintain consistent looking. Thus I crafted Bounce design system.

These are the redesigned login and sign up page with the new design system. More to come!

## Reflection

This project is the first time that I put a complete, except user research, user interface design process into practice with clear roadmap and goals. On the other hand, through communications with the co-founders and developers, I gained better understanding about how designs are iterated. Such communications also help me with learn how to communicate efficiently in workspace.
