## Background

In late October, 2018, Betalab signed contract with Connectiv8, a platform for students and businesses to collaborate through paid projects, on redesigning and developing their entire website. As the design lead of Betalab, I took the task of designing a new Connectiv8 platform from scratch.

The current old Connectiv8 was developed back in 2015 and it is static web page rather than a platform. A renovated website would attract more users by increasing the exposure of opportunities and easing the communication.

## Starting Design

Sitting down and meeting with Julie Schneiderman, Connectiv8's co-founder for an hour, I gained a good understanding of how Connectiv8 worked as a platform between freelancer students and business. I came up with a diagram to illustrate the general userflow.

Then I drew a quick wireframe of the platform structure.

## Designing

To lower the codes needed, Julie and I decided to have very similar layouts and elements on both student side and business side, with minimum modification. Therefore, designs were carried out at the same time on both sides.

Also, starting from prototype stage, the design was made in grid system to prepare for the implementation based on Bootstrap.

	<img src="/images/connectiv8/proto_project.png">
	<img src="/images/connectiv8/proto_profile.png">
	<img src="/images/connectiv8/proto_conversation.png">
</div>

## Output

The design was then turned to higher fidelity and presented on another meeting. The clients were satisfied.
