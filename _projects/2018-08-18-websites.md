Here I am presenting a collection of websites that I designed. 

## Diskfit

DiskFit is a code for modelling asymmetries in either photometry (fitting images) or kinematics (fitting velocity fields) of disk galaxies. The redesign of the original was discussed with Betalab and I refreshed Diskfit with a brand new looking.

## OPS

My firend Pranay Ramash from Queen's Smith School of Business is having an internship at a pest control company and he is launching his new pest control service brand with support from the main company. He approached me to design a landing page from scratch that converts visitor to customer and showcases his brand.

## QAPP

I joined QAPP (Queen's Application Development Society) as UI/UX designer in October 2017, and soon I was assigned the task of designing the QAPP's website. It is also the first piece of design of mine in university. So here is my design.

The website has a header, basic introductory info, team members, and job opening sections.

## Betalab

After a year QAPP was established, we upgraded our brand to Betalab, and started to focus on product, data science, and development operations. Therefore, I reworked the website design with completely new looking to get ready for fall hiring. It took a week as well.

On the new website, the header and intro sections were merged, a project showcase section was added, and I designed a new team member directory.

The design presents my improved skills of using colors and illustrations.

Some iterations the co-founders and I went through:

</div>

Thank you for viewing.

## Outflow

This a rapid prototype made by me in a single day. Outflow is an app from Ozzie Kirby, a great friend of mine interested in iOS development. He was planning to refresh the app with a new design so I was asked to create a landing page.

Outflow tracks and helps user manage all of his/her subscription services. The website aims to provide an impressive branding, a quick link to download the app, and some short feature descriptions.

Here is what I handed to him within 3 hours.
