## 2018 June: Designing for iOS

While working in QAPP during June 2018, I was assigned to the task of designing Lukabox's interface after my teammate Nakul had the wireframe completed. Lukabox is an iOS app that tracks and reminds people taking pills and helps them set daily health goals. The project is maintained by Vinson Lee, our client, undergraduate at Queen's School of Business.

### Design

The design was iterated numerous times with my managers' and clients' feedbacks posted on Zeplin. Special thanks to them as they helped me grow a sense of how to work with clients.

### Interactive Mockup

According to client's requirement, I built an interactive prototype to demonstrate basic interactions. The prototype is made with Origami studio by Facebook.

### 2019 May: Designing a bigger picture

In April, 2019, Vinson introduced me the next step of Lukabox, and it was big. Lukabox is going to develop a pill box that connects to phone app, giving the platform ability to sense if a pill is taken or not. The expansion to hardware gives Lukabox new opportunities to grow. 

My task in the project is to design Lukabox's website, including landing page and other pages such as support. The goal is to achieve good conversion to generate customers and maintain their loyalty. The design aims to be done within a 2 week frame. The project has not been done yet so this story is still work in progress. 

#### Timeline

First of all, Vinson's team and I had a few discussions and we generated a timeline,detailing the deliverables of each phase.

#### User Research

Next, to ensure the effectiveness of the website, I performed user research and had phone calls to Vinson's team. The outcome are 3 personas describing out target audience.

	<img src="/images/lukabox/persona3.png">
</div>

Based on the personas, I designed experience map to break down user's feelings and thoughts at each stage. This gives me a even closer look at the goals of the website in difference cases.

As the research progressed, the goals of the website are more closely mapped to the contents of the website.

</div>

#### Wireframe

I started wireframing, the first step to visual outcome by organizing the contents in to an order that step by step, builds viewer's trust on Lukabox. 

1. **Baseline relevance and trust that needs can be met**: neatly polished close shots and feature explanation 
2. **Interest and preference over other options**: well made video clearly demos the products, defined benefits to parent and children instead of some emotional words that just sound nice, testimonials 
3. **Trust with personal information**: ask the user if he/she would like to leave email/other contact info for newsletter
4. **Trust with sensitive/financial information**: ordering part shows what price for what thing - clean and organized  
5. **Willingness to commit to an ongoing relationship**: a good and trust worthy support service, "need help?" part following the order section gives the visitor the information that concrete support service is available, and actively updated blog shows our responsibility and keep subscribers notified of every move

After posting the first draft (left) onto Zeplin for review, I received nearly a hundred comments and I worked towards a high fidelity mockup (right) through feedbacks and iterations. 

The images of iPhone and Tesla are used as temporary placeholder.

The project is working in progress so I will update this story shortly.
