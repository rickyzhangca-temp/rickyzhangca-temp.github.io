This is the project I worked in group in an introductory level UX course at Peking University. It is a pure design project and we started from brain storming. I took the lead of the team and worked as the main role on team coordination, user research, wireframing, and prototyping. Thanks to the classroom environment, I had a chance to perform some basic user experience research. It was fantastic.

# Introduction

## Team

## Problems

Our team members come from universities across a wide variety of regions, China mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, United States, and Canada, with various backgrounds cognitive science, psychology, computer science and public policy. However, we all found that course selection is simply frustrating due to the problematic user experience of the systems. 

Those outdated, badly designed course selection systems have caused tremendous waste of time and energy for student and staffs, while still costs universities a lot of resources and budget to maintain and update. 

## Solution

This project is to design a product that serves as course selection system for universities, named Kurta. Kurta is a solution that is not for a specific university only, but a template with robust framework, enabling it to be easily deployed to any universities, while also customizable and extensible. It demonstrates the possibility of building a system around the universal course selection userflow.

## Vision 

Kurta might be remaining as a concept for years, but we hope Kurta gives universities and businesses an inspiration on how to address the problem. It reveals a huge potential market, improves user experience, standardizes the fractured current systems, and dramatically decreases the costs for universities.

In summary, Kurta has three goals, being user-friendly, universal and extensible, and budget friendly.

# Roadmap

To plan out the roadmap, our team first operationalized Kurta's visions and we proposed three design goals to follow and accomplish.

#### Universal
Kurta is designed based on a universal framework of course selection userflow. It is to meet the requirements of as many as possible universities. The interface needs to be customizable to display different themes, and extensible to contain extensions and unique features required by client university. Finally, Kurta should have good consideration on accessibility, and be internationalized.

#### Goal-directed
Being goal-directed is the principle of Kurta's design. User interview and testing should always be conducted through the processes so that product performs well on different user groups and scenarios.

#### Clear
The word might sound simple, but it involves much thinking and designing to achieve. Kurta needs a well-crafted, powerful product model, yet easy to understand. User is always well aware about the states, steps and processes of his/her course selection, and the whole selection does not take heavy workload.

During July 2018, we together planned out the timeline for the project's first stage. The rest of the project will be completed individually later on, if interested.

# User Research

## Target Users

In the first stage, we focus on the student end. Staff ends will be addressed in future stages.

## Persona 

After interviewing 17 students, we produced two personas from them to support our design.

## Locating the problems

#### Confusing information architecture

After conducting card sorting and tree testing, we revealed from the data that the information architecture needed a rework, since it took user too long to understand the structure of the current systems, and they still found hard to reach specific features/information, espicially for beginners.

We will be increasing the efficiency of using the system through Kurta.

#### Redundant mouse clicking and page redirecting

By recording and analyzing user behavior, we identified a serious overload on the number of clicking and redirecting needed to complete tasks. One of our goals is decrease the number of unnecessary actions.

An example of viewing a course's detailed information on Queen's University SOLUS is shown below.

#### No help information being offered

The current course selection systems we examined does not provide support information or features in real time. During the interview, one unhappy experience mentioned multiple times is "unable to get help". The experience is even worse for froshmen. Kurta is to contain handy help info and also provide a number of useful supporting features.

#### Fractured user flow

The most mentioned and frustrating experience we revealed from the interviews was checking required courses managing the time table. An important feature Kurta will offer is a powerful and life-saving timetable.

Here is a storyboard of selecting courses on Queen's University SOLUS from us made by me.

# Demo

Below is video demonstrating how a course is selected through Kurta. Interactions are done in ProtoPie.

More demo videos are on the horizon.

# Outcome

## Improvements on information architecture

The card sorting and tree testing are performed again on the same group of candidates to examine the performance of Kurta. The results are positive as it is much easier and quicker for candidates to reach the wanted information.
