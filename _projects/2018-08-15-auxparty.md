Aux Party is an iOS app that enables people to share and co-edit the playlists during parties and other events. My friend Raed Fayad at Betalab planned to take this idea to a pitch competition, therefore he reached me out for a few screens that he wanted to present on the slides.

I asked him about the branding, spirits, any design preference, and we together worked on the wireframing. 

The three screens needed were: a landing screen for user to sign in or sign up, a mode selection that allows users to pick a mode on how playlists will be decided, and a voting screen demonstrating how people can decide what music are the best to play.

</div>

Here is my work done in 2 hours of rapid design.

Thank you for the interest!
